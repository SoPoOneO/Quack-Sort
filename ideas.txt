- duck looks at you and lays egg in hand/wing and throws it at screen if you got a really bad score
- ducks are in proportional sizes and wear their numbers on sights on their necks
- hints, where a duck subtly signals with wink or holding hand up
- active duck comes forward and shows bigger
- arrows show in bounces to each target, possibly along top and bottom for directions
- maybe instead of wrapping, numbers that go around the edge bounce
- for object continuity, moves are actually depicted by each object smoothly travelling to new location
